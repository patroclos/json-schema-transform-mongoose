# Description

This project is part of a framework I am currently developing with emphasis on the incorporation of json-schema everywhere in the stack from generating rest apis and database models to socketio, form-generation and request validation

# What works
(partially) supported types: string, integer, array, object

constraints:
- string length
- enum
- string pattern
- integer bounds

# Contributing

Just fork the repo, make a new branch from the dev branch called something like 'feature-whateveryourdoing', do your thing and put up a pull request.
